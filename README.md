# catcherframing

The purpose of this repository is to identify which catcher was the best at framing pitches behind the plate. 
A bit of exploratory analysis was conducted to see what kind of data was in the package. 
Data wrangling was used to isolate what is considered a "framed" pitch and grouped by catcherids.
Conclusions were drawn based on findings.
